###List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
<br/>
1. **Loops**- Loops are functions that can do repeated tasks which are specifies within the loop function. 
The number of iterations can be either pre-defined or continue until a specified condition is met (which is specified in the loop parameters). 
There are many types and subtypes of loops; the most common loops are: *for* **loops **, which have a pre-defined number of iterations; *while* **loops ** which do **not** have a pre-defined number of iterations, but rather keep looping until a specific condition is met; *do-while* **loops** are like *while* loops, but does the task at least once before looking at the condition to be met.

2. **What is JavaScript >:)**- JavaScript is a dynamic programming language, meaning it's SMART! ! ! ! ! It can tell that "10" and 10 are the same even if they are different data types, and it can hoist variables (hoist is basically JavaScript can look for the value of the variable almost anywhere in the code) even if they were not initially defined (except when using let). 

3. **Arithmetic Operations**- Javascript lets its users do calculations as it accepts standard arithmetic operations. The signs for addition, subtractiom, multiplication and division are +, -, *, /, respectively. You can also get the remainder when dividing by using the % (modulo) sign. You can also declare a variable then change its values with the arithmetic operations by inputting the operator sign then equals (ex. declare x=1 and y=5; next input x+=y, which is equivalent to x=x+y and changes the value of x into 6). Lastly, you can increment and decrement using ++ and -- respectively.

4. **JavaScript Data Types**- Javascript has six data types, I am most familliar with only five as the sixth (known as symbol) is a datatype I don't use that often and don't completely understand. The first data type is the **string** which is used for word and letters, basically it is used for text. The second data type is **number**, which is self explanatory, it is the data type for numbers and can be used for arithmetic operations. Note that a number with quotation marks, whether double or single are considered strings (ex. '90' , "10), but depending on the context, Javascript may interpret it as a number (ex. "10" - 8 will still be equal to 2). The third data type is **boolean**, which is usually used with logical operators (&&, ||, ==, !) and can only return two values: true or false (ex. x=5, y=9; x==y will be false). The fourth data type is **undefined**, which is basically variables that have no value (ex. if you declare x without a value,  when you try to get the value, it will return as undefined. The last data type is **null**, which is when a variable intentionally has no value (ex. x=null).

5. **Ways of declaring a variable**- Javascript allows its users to declae a variable in three ways. The first way is by using the **var**
keyword; it is a flexible way of declaring a variable. The second way is using the **let** keyword; it is like the var keyword but you cannot use a variable declared with let everywhere unless it has been passed down (ex. you can't use a let variable within a function for another function unless you pass it down), you cannot also redeclare a let variable. The last way is by using the **const** keyword, it is mot similar to the let keyword, but with the addition that you cannot redefine a const variable (ex. const x=5; const y= 10; x*=y will not change the x values into 50 because it uses the const declaration).

###List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.

1. **Functions**- Functions are basically houses, and the people within it are the code; then you can knock on the house then the people will do a required task (you can call the function to run the code in it). I need more practice on functions because I get confused on how to pass down information within a function to other functions as well as when to know is a block of code should be in a separate function.

2. **Arrays**- If functions are houses for code, arrays are houses for variables; you can knock on the house, call a person (an element in the array) then they will go out. You can use a specific element in an array by inputting in you code arrayName[n], in whih n is the element number, the first element starts with the element number 0. I need more practice in this because I got confused in the bonus activity because i wanted know how to know if all the elements in the array are called so that I could display a message.

3. **Using return**- Return is used to pass information between functions. I need more practice on it because I don't use it that much and I also get confused where to put it and when to use it.

4. **HTML properties**- They are used with getElementById and other arguments. HTML properties are .innerHTML, .innerText, .innerContent. InnerHTML gets all of the properties including HTML tags, innerContent is like innerHTML but without the HTML tags and innerText is just the text without the extra spacing and HTML tags. I need more practice on this because I may interchange them sometimes.

5.**HTML Events**- They are used to trigger a block of code when a desired event occurs (like page loading or clicking). I need more practice with this as I mostly only used onclick and used the addEventListener function; I haven't used onload yet.

###Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
<br/>
To help myself understand these topics, I would: 
<br/>
1. Watch videos or read websites (like WW3 Schools) to get more detailed explainations on these topics. 
2. Ask a teacher or classmate for help if I really don't understand
3. Put the topics into practice by making my own code with them
4. Solve problems in CodeChef>:)

###In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
<br/>
Effective:
1. 6th Graded Exercise-It helped m understand Arithmetic Operations more, as well as how it can be used with for loops. It also helped me understand how for loops processs information. It really helped me since it was explained to me by my teacher and batchmate.
2. 7th Graded Exercise- This one also helped me understand Arithmetic Operations, as well as how the return keyword is used, though I still need more practice in using return.
<br/>
Least Effective:
1. 4th Graded Exercise-It helped me, but the reason why it wasn't that effective for me to understand case-switch control statements is because I already understood well how case-switch worked.
2. L4 Bonus Exercise-The reason why it wasn't very effective for me in understanding arrays and functions is because I still don't understand how it works entirely and thet's why I wasn't able to add all the features I wanted to add to my guessing game website.
