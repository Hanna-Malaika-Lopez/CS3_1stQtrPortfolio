###List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
1. **Loops**- Loops are functions that can do repeated tasks which are specifies within the loop function. 
The number of iterations can be either pre-defined or continue until a specified condition is met (which is specified in the loop parameters). 
There are many types and subtypes of loops; the most common loops are: *for* **loops **, which have a pre-defined number of iterations; *while* **loops ** which do **not** have a pre-defined number of iterations, but rather keep looping until a specific condition is met; *do-while* **loops** are like *while* loops, but does the task at least once before looking at the condition to be met.

2. **What is JavaScript >:)**- JavaScript is a dynamic programming language, meaning it's SMART! ! ! ! ! It can tell that "10" and 10 are the same even if they are different data types,
3. and it can hoist (hoist is basically JavaScript can look for the value of the variable almost anywhere in the code) even if it was not initially defined (except when using let).
